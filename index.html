        <h1>A little bit about myself</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is Radim Říha and I am an electronics enthusiast.<br>
        I live in the Czech republic and currently study for a bachelors degree in automation.
        My goal is to learn as much as possible about this field to become a better engineer, create the technology of tommorrow and maybe not blow
        up my lab in the process.<br>
        Learning is also the reason I created this website. To enhance my programming knowledge and general computer skills.</p>
        <p>I have been interested in EE since when I was around 12 years old and I am still amazed by the beauty of technology to this day.
        I like developing all sorts of hardware gadgets, computers, amplifiers, power supplies, watches, robots, etc.</p>
        <p>My main focus is on creating hardware that is useful in my everyday life, including the firmware or other tools that are needed for its operation.</p>
        <p>Currently I work for the company Glow tube research s.r.o., which is owned by Dalibor Farný. One of the only nixie tube manufacturers in the world.
        We manufacture new nixie tubes as well as nixie tube clocks and I create machines needed for the production of nixies, since many of the machines needed
        are either not produced anymore, or were never produced in the first place. This is where my interest for nixie tubes comes from, as you might have
        noticed in some of my personal projects.</p>
        <h3>My journey through education</h3>
        <p>When I was in elementary school my mum signed me up for an electronics club where I got my first real introduction to electronics.
        I have been hooked ever since I saw my first blinky thingy work. How does it work? How is something like this even possible? After elementary
        school I entered highschool in the electronics field which I successfully completed in 2019 and went for college right away.
        I remember I used to think that everything in engineering has already been figured out and that I would never be able to understand this magic,
        yet here I am, 8 years later, creating my own stuff (although some days I would swear I still witness magic). It has been a lot of work and
        there is much more to discover and learn. There are many years to come, many things to learn, and I hope I will make it through this all in one
        piece and with great memories. Keep on truckin' everyone and don't forget to have fun!</p>
